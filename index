<h1>The Legend Of Bongo Scout</h1>
<p>The bongo scout is quite a rare creature.</p>
<p>Many people go their entire lives without seeing a bongo scout.</p>
<p> the bongo scout is quite admirable.
it can bongo all day and can play the bongo's until it falls asleep for about 6 hours until it wakes up.
it starts playing bongo's a few mintues BEFORE waking up and then doesnt stop until it falls asleep. <p/>
<p> many bongo musicians try to be like the bongo scout, but these people are no different than furries. <p/>
<p> since the bongo scout is considered an animal with a slightly different body.<p/>
<p> the bongo scout eats music and drinks music
which is why they live without eating like other animals <p/>
